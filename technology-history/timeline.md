## 1953

[The Transistor: a 1953 documentary, anticipating its coming impact on technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9xUQWo4vN0) \#video - "Made between the 1947 invention of the transistor at Bell Labs and the 1956 awarding of the Nobel Prize for Physics to its creators, this documentary is less about the discovery itself than its anticipated impact on technology and society. The intent of the film was clearly to give the public of that era their first understanding of what a transistor was and why it mattered so much."

## 1959

[AT&T Archives: Similiarities of Wave Behavior \(Bonus Edition\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DovunOxlY1k) \#video - "On an elementary conceptual level, this film reflects the multifaceted scientific hyperthinking that was typical of a Bell Labs approach. Host Dr. J.N. Shive's presence as a lecturer is excellent - it's understandable by a layperson even when he branches into equations, because he uses copious amounts of real-world examples to bolster the material."

## 1965

Bardeen had left the labs in 1951 for the U. of IL; Shockley in 1956 to run a semiconductor company in California \(laying the groundwork for Silicon Valley\), and Brattain retired in 1967 to Whitman College."

Even 10 years after its first installation, it's still an introduction to the system. The other film, "The UNIX System: Making Computers Easier to Use", is roughly the same, only a little shorter. The former film was geared towards software developers and computer science students, the latter towards programmers specifically."

[ENEMIES NO MORE: MICROSOFT BRINGS THE LINUX KERNEL TO WINDOWS](https://www.wired.com/story/enemies-no-more-microsoft-brings-linux-kernel-windows/) \#article - "FOR DECADES, MICROSOFT Windows and the [open source](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-open-source-software/)Linux operating system were polar opposites. Windows was developed by the biggest software company in the world, one that was no friend to open source. [Linux](https://www.wired.com/tag/linux/) was developed by a ragtag team of programmers scattered around the world, often working in their spare time. But over the years, open source, and Linux in particular, went mainstream. Linux now powers the majority of the world's web servers and underpins Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system. That forced a change in how Microsoft treated the rival operating system. First it began [supporting Linux](https://www.wired.com/2012/05/microsoft-linux/) on its cloud service Azure. Then it began releasing software for Android and Linux and even [using Linux internally](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/now-can-use-linux-just-like-microsoft/) to power Azure. Now Microsoft is bringing the heart of Linux into Windows."
