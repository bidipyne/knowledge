[Conditions for CSS Variables](http://kizu.ru/en/fun/conditions-for-css-variables/) \#article - “So, what we need is a way to use a sin­gle CSS vari­able for set­ting dif­fer­ent CSS prop­er­ties to dif­fer­ent val­ues, but not based di­rectly on this vari­able \(that is — those val­ues shouldn't be cal­cu­lated from our vari­able\). We need con­di­tions.” Using CSS variables as booleans.

[pointer-events](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/pointer-events/) \#article - “The pointer-events property allows for control over how HTML elements respond to mouse/touch events – including CSS hover/active states, click/tap events in Javascript, and whether or not the cursor is visible.” Also allows you to pass click events through an element to whatever it’s behind it by using \`pointer-events: none;\` \#chris\_coyier \#css-tricks

[Quantity Queries for CSS](http://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css) \#article - “This is your guide to creating style breakpoints for quantities of HTML elements, much as you already do with @media queries for viewport dimensions. I’m not pointing at some blurry specification in the distance or a twinkle in an implementer’s eye. We’re going to do this today, with CSS that’s already available.”

[Understanding CSS Layout And The Block Formatting Context](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/understanding-css-layout-block-formatting-context/) \#article - By Rachel Andrew. “There are a few concepts in CSS layout that can really enhance your CSS game once you understand them. This article is about the Block Formatting Context \(BFC\). You may never have heard of this term, but if you have ever made a layout with CSS, you probably know what it is. Understanding what a BFC is, why it works, and how to create one is useful and can help you to understand how layout works in CSS.”

[Understanding Variable Scope And Variable Injection In Less CSS](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2642-understanding-variable-scope-and-variable-injection-in-less-css.htm) \#article - "The Less CSS preprocessor allows you to define variables that can be used throughout your CSS structure; however, as I have been digging into Less CSS more, I have found the rules around variable assignment and variable visibility to be a bit confusing. Sometimes variables can be overridden; sometimes they can't. Sometimes they can bubble-up; sometimes they can't. As such, I thought this would make a valuable exploration."

## Resets

[Eric Meyer: Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - "The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the `body` element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on."

[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - "[Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing."

[Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/) - "Reboot, a collection of element-specific CSS changes in a single file, kickstart Bootstrap to provide an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon."
