# Accessibility & Usability

[Calculating Color Contrast](https://24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast/) \#article - “Some websites and services allow you to customize your profile by uploading pictures, changing the background color or other aspects of the design. As a customer, this personalization turns a web app into your little nest where you store your data. As a designer, letting your customers have free rein over the layout and design is a scary prospect. So what happens to all the stock text and images that are designed to work on nice white backgrounds? Even the Mac only lets you choose between two colors for the OS, blue or graphite! Opening up the ability to customize your site’s color scheme can be a recipe for disaster unless you are flexible and understand how to find maximum color contrasts.” \#javascript \#php \#color \#accessibility

Rather than a direct transcription of the video course, it is meant to be a more concise treatment of accessibility principles and practices, using the course's original content as a base."

[Hostile Design](https://hostiledesign.org/) - “Hostile designs are designs against humanity. They are made specifically to exclude, harm or otherwise hinder the freedom of a human being. Quite often they aim to remove a certain section of a community from a public space.”

[Intro to ARIA -- A11ycasts \#13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Qff0b-lHk) \#video - "Here on a11ycasts I always try to encourage developers to use native controls rather than roll their own mainly because you get semantics and keyboard functionality for free. But there are situations where you need to build something and there's no native analog in the platform. For these occasions when you need to go offroad and build your own control, the Web Content Accessibility Initiatives Accessible Rich Internet Applications spec \(WAI-ARIA\) can help you add in the semantics your new custom control is missing. Today on the show I'll cover what ARIA is from a high level and show off some of the features and relationships ARIA let's you take advantage of."

[Julie Grundy – The UX of Form Design: Designing an Effective Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPS7LUW7SlA) \#video - "Forms are critical user’s experience. We have clear guidelines to follow, yet these guidelines are often are overlooked.

[Pixels vs. Ems: Users DO Change Font Size](https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773) \#article - “The question was “How many users browse the main Internet Archive site with a default font size other than the common value of 16 pixels?” By knowing this, we would determine how many users would be affected by sizing with relative units like rems/ems. Using the methodology I describe below, we found that the answer is 3.08% of our users. That’s a pretty big number, higher than most counts of the market share of browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, or Opera Mini.”

[Web Accessibility by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891) \#course - Free. "In this course you’ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then you’ll dive into the "how": making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus \(e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.\) You’ll understand what "semantics" and "semantic markup" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably."

## Testing

[Accessibility Testing - Totally Tooling Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56zCnwj58e4) \#video - "In this episode, Addy chats with Rob Dodson, a developer advocate on the Chrome team, about his workflow for accessibility testing.

When auditing a page, Lighthouse runs a barrage of tests against the page, and then generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as indicators on what you can do to improve your app."

## Touch Targets

[Tap targets are not sized appropriately](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/tap-targets) \#article - "Tap targets are interactive elements, like buttons or links, that users frequently tap. Appropriately-sized tap targets make pages more mobile-friendly and accessible. Google Search started boosting the ranking of mobile-friendly pages on mobile search results back in 2015. See [Rolling out the mobile-friendly update](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html)."

[Touch target size](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7101858?hl=en) \#article - "Any on-screen element that someone can click, touch, or otherwise interact with should be large enough for reliable interaction. Consider making sure these elements have a width and height of at least 48dp, as described in the [Material Design Accessibility guidelines](https://material.google.com/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-layout)."
