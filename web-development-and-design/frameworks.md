# Frameworks

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - “Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world’s most popular front-end component library. Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.”

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) - "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js"

[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) - "The next small thing in web development. Sapper is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing. ❡ Unlike single-page apps, Sapper doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the initial load experience — but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is instantaneous for that app-like feel."

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - "Cybernetically enhanced web apps. Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the _browser_, Svelte shifts that work into a _compile step_ that happens when you build your app. ❡ Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes."

### Hooks

[Deep dive: How do React hooks really work?](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/11/deep-dive-how-do-react-hooks-really-work/) \#article - "[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks) are a fundamentally simpler way to encapsulate stateful behavior and side effects in user interfaces. They were [first introduced in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM) and have been broadly embraced by other frameworks like [Vue](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/), [Svelte](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1093260097558581250), and even adapted for [general functional JS](https://github.com/getify/TNG-Hooks). However, their functional design requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript."

[Getting Closure on Hooks \(JSConf Edition\)](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/react-hooks/) \#video - "The design of React Hooks requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this talk, we’ll reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!"

[Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) \#article - "_Hooks_ are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class."
