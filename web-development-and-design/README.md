[Microsoft Edge virtual machines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) - "Test Microsoft Edge \(EdgeHTML\) and versions of IE8 through IE11 using free virtual machines you download and manage locally."

[Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=extension) \#article - "When you open another page using `target="_blank"`, the other page may run on the same process as your page, unless [Site Isolation](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/site-isolation) is enabled. If the other page is running a lot of JavaScript, your page's performance may also suffer. See [The Performance Benefits of `rel=noopener`](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/)."

## Security

[Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=extension) \#article - "The other page can access your `window` object with the `window.opener` property. This exposes an [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) because the other page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL. See [About rel=noopener](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/)."

## Testing

[Lighthouse Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) - "Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps. When auditing a page, Lighthouse runs a barrage of tests against the page, and then generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as indicators on what you can do to improve your app."
