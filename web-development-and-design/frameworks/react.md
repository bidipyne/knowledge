## Hooks

[A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) \#article - "When I just started using Hooks, I was confused by all of those questions too. Even when writing the initial docs, I didn’t have a firm grasp on some of the subtleties. I’ve since had a few “aha” moments that I want to share with you. **This deep dive will make the answers to these questions look obvious to you."**

[Deep dive: How do React hooks really work?](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/11/deep-dive-how-do-react-hooks-really-work/) \#article - "[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks) are a fundamentally simpler way to encapsulate stateful behavior and side effects in user interfaces. They were [first introduced in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM) and have been broadly embraced by other frameworks like [Vue](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/), [Svelte](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1093260097558581250), and even adapted for [general functional JS](https://github.com/getify/TNG-Hooks). However, their functional design requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript."

[Getting Closure on Hooks \(JSConf Edition\)](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/react-hooks/) \#video - "The design of React Hooks requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this talk, we’ll reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!"

[How to fetch data with React Hooks?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data) \#article - "In this tutorial, I want to show you **how to fetch data in React with Hooks** by using the [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) and [effect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) hooks. We will use the widely known [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to fetch popular articles from the tech world. You will also implement your custom hook for the data fetching that can be reused anywhere in your application or published on npm as standalone node package."

[Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) \#article - "_Hooks_ are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class."

[Run useEffect Only Once](https://css-tricks.com/run-useeffect-only-once/) \#article - "The trick is that `useEffect` takes a second parameter."
