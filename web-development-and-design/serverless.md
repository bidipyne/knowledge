# Serverless



[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - "Run code without thinking about servers. Pay only for the compute time you consume."

[Chris Coyier - The All Powerful Front End Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grSxHfGoaeg) \#video - “The internet is, without metaphor, just a bunch of servers tied together with wires. Without servers, we'd have no way to share our creations with the world. Yet, in a bit of a paradox, servers are less essential to our work than they've ever been. We can now do things on the front-end that used to require a back end. When we do need a back end, our front-end skills can be put to work, giving us some surprisingly powerful new abilities. Join Chris on a whirlwind tour of the tools, tech, and code that puts more power than ever into our front-end hands.”

[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) - "Event-driven serverless compute platform"

[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) - "Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup."

[JAMstack\_conf](https://jamstackconf.com/) - “Attend the premier event to learn how to design, develop, and deploy fast, modern web projects that run without web servers.” [JAMstack Conf on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8bRyfU7ycLXnEBfvdorpUg)

[Find a domain, create a site, and get custom email](https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Learning-Cloud-Computing-Serverless-Computing/728399-2.html) \#course - "Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. This training course is targeted at IT professionals who need to gain a foundational knowledge of serverless computing—what it is and why it's important—and what's offered by serverless computing technologies like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. Instructor David Linthicum begins with the basics: what serverless computing is and the problems it can solve. He then runs through demos of both Lambda and Functions and explores effective use cases for serverless computing."

[The Power of Serverless for Front-End Developers](https://thepowerofserverless.info/) - “Web developers of all kinds can take advantage of it, but this site is particularly interested in how it relates to and helps front-end web developers. Here's one way to think about it: you can take your front-end skills and do things that typically only a back-end can do. You can write a JavaScript function that you run and receive a response from by hitting a URL. That's sometimes also called Cloud Functions or Functions as a Service, which are perhaps better names, but just a part of the whole serverless thing.”

[serverless](https://serverless.com/) - "The most widely-adopted toolkit for building serverless applications."

[Webtask](https://webtask.io/) - “All you need is code. Make serverless endpoints.”
