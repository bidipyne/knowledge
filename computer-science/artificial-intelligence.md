[A bold idea to replace politicians \| César Hidalgo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGWML6cI_k) \#video - "César Hidalgo has a radical suggestion for fixing our broken political system: automate it! In this provocative talk, he outlines a bold idea to bypass politicians by empowering citizens to create personalized AI representatives that participate directly in democratic decisions. Explore a new way to make collective decisions and expand your understanding of democracy."

[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J5bDQHQR1g&list=PLIilwIraDV2L3QailjC91OkRaIioM0DYv&index=2) \#video - "Intelligent machines are no longer science fiction and experts seem divided as to whether artificial intelligence should be feared or welcomed. In this video I explore a broad range AI research while attempting to envision a future where man and machine can coexist."

[ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MAY NOT 'HALLUCINATE' AFTER ALL](https://www.wired.com/story/adversarial-examples-ai-may-not-hallucinate/) \#article - "THANKS TO ADVANCES in [machine learning](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-intelligence/), computers have gotten really good at identifying what’s in photographs. They started [beating humans](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/13/baidu-minwa-supercomputer-better-than-humans-recognising-images) at the task years ago, and can now even generate [fake images](https://www.wired.com/story/is-this-photo-real-ai-getting-better-faking-images/) that look eerily real. While the technology has come a long way, it’s still not entirely foolproof. In particular, researchers have found that image detection algorithms remain susceptible to a class of problems called [adversarial examples](https://www.wired.com/story/researcher-fooled-a-google-ai-into-thinking-a-rifle-was-a-helicopter/)."

[_Deep Medicine_](https://drerictopol.com/book/deep-medicine/) \#book - "Medicine has become inhuman, to disastrous effect. The doctor-patient relationship–the heart of medicine–is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard."

[A First Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqSDWoAhvLU&list=PLIilwIraDV2JkPdIwldXw3jav0kNO0iO_) \#video - "Fully autonomous driving has always been the goal of our project, because we think this could improve road safety and help lots of people who can't drive. We're now developing prototypes of vehicles that have been designed from the ground up to drive themselves—just push a button and they'll take you where you want to go! We'll use these vehicles to test our software and learn what it will really take to bring this technology into the world."

[Life-like Gaming is Now Possible \(Thanks to A.I.\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQlQQSsC47g&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "A.I. is making its way into gaming, with real-time ray tracing now possible, what other things does A.I. have in store?"

[Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI \| A WIRED Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJixNvx9BAc) \#video - "“Machine Learning: Living in the Age of AI,” examines the extraordinary ways in which people are interacting with AI today. Hobbyists and teenagers are now developing tech powered by machine learning and WIRED shows the impacts of AI on schoolchildren and farmers and senior citizens, as well as looking at the implications that rapidly accelerating technology can have. The film was directed by filmmaker Chris Cannucciari, produced by WIRED, and supported by McCann Worldgroup."

[SPEND PART OF THE $2 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ON ROBOTS](https://www.wired.com/story/infrastructure-plan-robots/) \#article - "New technologies are threatening jobs, but they also offer the possibility of completing projects we otherwise couldn't afford, minimizing disruption, improving safety, and optimizing systems in ways humans working alone could not. Robots and artificial intelligence can help us build the infrastructure we need, here and around the world. In short, the infrastructure robots are coming; in fact, some of them are already here."

[Which Jobs Should You Avoid Because Robots Will Take Them First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj9OGupiC1s&list=PLIilwIraDV2JkPdIwldXw3jav0kNO0iO_&index=2) \#video - "Robots are taking our jobs left and right, but we wanted to take a look at which jobs are going to be replaced by robots \(ai & automation\) first. In this episode, let's compare Robots vs Humans."

[THE WIRED GUIDE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-intelligence/?itm_campaign=GuideCarveLeft) \#article - "Superintelligent algorithms aren’t about to take all the jobs or wipe out humanity. But software has gotten significantly smarter of late. It’s why you can talk to your friends as an animated poop on the iPhone X using Apple’s Animoji, or ask your smart speaker to order more paper towels."

## Deep Learning

[The Deep Learning Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy0hJWltsyE&list=PLIilwIraDV2L3QailjC91OkRaIioM0DYv&index=2) \#video - "More info at: [http://www.nvidia.com/deep-learning](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=_QWqt8H0m8eIote0KkYxHus8muZ8MTU2MTM5MTcxMEAxNTYxMzA1MzEw&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fdeep-learning&v=Dy0hJWltsyE&event=video_description) Deep learning is the fastest-growing field in artificial intelligence, helping computers make sense of infinite amounts of data in the form of images, sound, and text. Using multiple levels of neural networks, computers now have the capacity to see, learn, and react to complex situations as well or better than humans. Every industry will be impacted by deep learning, and many businesses are already delivering new products and services based on this new way of thinking about data and technology."

[The Rise of Deep Learning \| Forbes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rB9YiBxp4I&list=PLIilwIraDV2L3QailjC91OkRaIioM0DYv&index=2&t=0s) \#video - "The hype around artificial intelligence has repeatedly come and gone over the past few decades. But the last few years have shown some pivotal breakthroughs primarily due to a branch of AI called deep learning."
