[ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MAY NOT 'HALLUCINATE' AFTER ALL](https://www.wired.com/story/adversarial-examples-ai-may-not-hallucinate/) \#article - "THANKS TO ADVANCES in [machine learning](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-intelligence/), computers have gotten really good at identifying what’s in photographs. They started [beating humans](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/13/baidu-minwa-supercomputer-better-than-humans-recognising-images) at the task years ago, and can now even generate [fake images](https://www.wired.com/story/is-this-photo-real-ai-getting-better-faking-images/) that look eerily real. While the technology has come a long way, it’s still not entirely foolproof. In particular, researchers have found that image detection algorithms remain susceptible to a class of problems called [adversarial examples](https://www.wired.com/story/researcher-fooled-a-google-ai-into-thinking-a-rifle-was-a-helicopter/)."

[SPEND PART OF THE $2 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ON ROBOTS](https://www.wired.com/story/infrastructure-plan-robots/) \#article - "New technologies are threatening jobs, but they also offer the possibility of completing projects we otherwise couldn't afford, minimizing disruption, improving safety, and optimizing systems in ways humans working alone could not. Robots and artificial intelligence can help us build the infrastructure we need, here and around the world. In short, the infrastructure robots are coming; in fact, some of them are already here."

[THE WIRED GUIDE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-intelligence/?itm_campaign=GuideCarveLeft) \#article - "Superintelligent algorithms aren’t about to take all the jobs or wipe out humanity. But software has gotten significantly smarter of late. It’s why you can talk to your friends as an animated poop on the iPhone X using Apple’s Animoji, or ask your smart speaker to order more paper towels."
