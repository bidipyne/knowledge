[PHYSICISTS ARE BEWITCHED BY TWISTED GRAPHENE'S 'MAGIC ANGLE'](https://www.wired.com/story/twisted-bilayer-graphene/) \#article - "Jarillo-Herrero has never been a slacker, but his activity has jumped several levels since his dramatic announcement in March 2018 that his lab at MIT had found superconductivity in twisted bilayer grapheneâ€”a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon crystal dropped on another one, and then rotated to leave the two layers slightly askew."

[THE WIRED GUIDE TO QUANTUM COMPUTING](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-quantum-computing/?itm_campaign=GuideCarveLeft&mbid=rss-google-newsstand) \#article - "BIG THINGS HAPPEN when computers get smaller. Or faster. And [quantum computing](https://www.wired.com/tag/quantum-computing/) is about chasing perhaps the biggest performance boost in the history of technology. The basic idea is to smash some barriers that limit the speed of existing computers by harnessing the counterintuitive physics of subatomic scales."
