[᚛ᚈᚑᚋ ᚄᚉᚑᚈᚈ᚜ and ᚛ᚑᚌᚐᚋ᚜](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yWWFLI5kFU) \#video - “Ogham is an old Irish script made by carving notches into stones. It fell out of use more than a millennium ago - but it's an interesting exception to a linguistics and computer-science rule that I'd never even realised existed. Let's talk about the Ogham Space Mark.” \#tomscott

[All The Colours, Including Grue: How Languages See Colours Differently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtnD4jmCDQ) \#video - “http://tomscott.com - @tomscott - Colours are easy, right? They're one of the first things you learn as a kid. But what if "blue" and "green" were the same colour? Or "light blue" and "dark blue" weren't? Well, guess what: there are languages out there that do exactly that.”

[How language changes the way we see colour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgxyfqHRPoE) \#video - “Business Insider spoke to writer, lecturer, and colour expert Gavin Evans about languages' impact on colour and how it affects our perception of it.”

[Keith Chen: Could your language affect your ability to save money?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3YTbubyjI) \#video - “What can economists learn from linguists? Behavioral economist Keith Chen introduces a fascinating pattern from his research: that languages without a concept for the future -- "It rain tomorrow," instead of "It will rain tomorrow" -- correlate strongly with high savings rates.”

[Neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism) \#article - Wikipedia. "A **neologism** \([/niːˈɒlədʒɪzəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) νέο- néo-, "new" and λόγος lógos, "speech, utterance"\) is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-1) Neologisms are often driven by changes in culture and technology,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-3) . In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than [protologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-4) A word whose development stage is between that of the [protologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism) \(freshly coined\) and neologism \(new word\) is a prelogism.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-5)"

[Poto and Cabengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poto_and_Cabengo) \#article - “Poto and Cabengo \(names given, respectively, by Grace and Virginia Kennedy to themselves\) are American identical twins who used an invented language until the age of about eight. Poto and Cabengo is also the name of a documentary film about the girls made by Jean-Pierre Gorin and released in 1980. The film Nell, based on the play Idioglossia, was partly inspired by the twins.\[1\]”

[Poto and Cabengo \(1980\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196866/) - “Two young twins in the USA have invented their own shared language. Scientists are wanting to study the language but social workers are trying to get the twins to leave their secret language world and enter the mainstream. This means forcing them to speak normal English and lose their secret language. The filmmaker's own questions about this process run across as text at the bottom of the screen, a first use of that technique in documentary.” \#documentary

[Seeing Voices](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66723.Seeing_Voices?ac=1&from_search=true) \#book - by Oliver Sacks. “Like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, this is a fascinating voyage into a strange and wonderful land, a provocative meditation on communication, biology, adaptation, and culture.  In Seeing Voices, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect--a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. Seeing Voices is, as Studs Terkel has written, "an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work."”

### **Feral Children**

[Feral Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child) \#article - “A feral child \(also called wild child\) is a human child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age, where they have little or no experience of human care, behavior, or, crucially, of human language. Some feral children have been confined by people \(usually their own parents\). Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away. Feral children are sometimes the subjects of folklore and legends, typically portrayed as having been raised by animals.”

[Genie \(feral child\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_%28feral_child%29) \#article - “Genie \(born 1957\) is the pseudonym for an American feral child who was a victim of severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] When she was a baby her father concluded that she was severely mentally retarded, a view which intensified as she got older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible as a result of this belief, so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished.\[4\]\[5\]\[6\] The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.\[1\]\[4\]\[7\]”

[Genie: Secret of the Wild Child](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/genie-secret-wild-child/) \#video - “This is an Emmy Award-winning documentary about a girl who spent her early life chained in a bedroom. Brought up in confinement, "Genie" was primitive, brutish, and hardly capable of walking or talking. NOVA follows the contentious attempts to unbolt the secret of the wild child who has reached near maturity in an agonizing seclusion with almost no human contact.” \#documentary
