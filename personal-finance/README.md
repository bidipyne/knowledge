## Frugality

[Living well on the trailing edge of Luxury](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/29/living-well-on-the-trailing-edge-of-luxury/) \#article - Mr. Money Mustache. "Because of this exponential change, our world is awash in almost-new consumer products. The hottest ones are in the stores, and the hottest ones from just a few months ago are abandoned in people’s drawers and garages. You almost NEVER need to buy anything new, because you can have an almost-new item for 25-50% of the cost out of one of these drawers. People are so accustomed to buying new things, that they are willing to almost give away their used things even when they are barely used."

[Cait Flanders](https://caitflanders.com/) \#blog - "Hi friend! My name is Cait. I’m an author, podcaster, and traveller from a beautiful island in British Columbia, Canada. For the past nine years, you could say I’ve been on a journey of less. Less debt. Less clutter. Less consumerism. Less alcohol \(ok, _no_ alcohol\). Less time online/on my phone. Less consumption overall. I wrote a self-help memoir that documents some of what I have experienced and discovered. [_The Year of Less_](https://caitflanders.com/the-year-of-less/) __came out in January 2018 and became a Wall Street Journal bestseller."
