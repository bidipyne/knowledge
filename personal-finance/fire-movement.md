[r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) - "This is a place for people who are or want to become Financially Independent \(FI\), which means not having to work for money. Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early \(RE\) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate \(through less spending and/or higher income\) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as fast as possible."
