1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

These steps aren't necessarily linear. They are iterative. Based on what you learn informs what step you should go to next.

Principles:

* **Have empathy.** Go out and seek to understand the people who are impacted by what you do. Try to identify latent needs.
* **Prototype everything.** Prototype early and often.
* **Be more collaborative.** Involve people with diverse backgrounds.
* **Innovation is a team sport.** Work within diverse teams.
* **Have a bias towards action.** If you're talking a lot, that's the time to get out and do something, try something out, have a conversation with someone. Don't just put your head down and think.
