# Testing

* [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) - “Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.” \#php
* [Metasyntactic variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) - “A metasyntactic variable is a specific word or set of words identified as a placeholder in computer science and specifically computer programming. … Metasyntactic variables used commonly across all programming languages include foobar, foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, and thud.\[1\]\[3\] Wibble, wobble, wubble, and flob are also used in the UK.”
* [Unit testing with timeouts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2975794/unit-testing-with-timeouts) \#article - “I am unit testing a class with a property whose value changes often, depending on communication it receives from another component. If the class does not receive any communication for 5 seconds, the property reverts to a default value. … How would you test to be sure that this property has the proper value when simulating various communication conditions?” \#q&a

### **Mutation Testing**

* [Infection](https://infection.github.io/) - \#php
* [Mutation Testing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/20905/mutation-testing) \#article - “Mutation testing is a method of software testing in which program or source code is deliberately manipulated, followed by suite of testing against the mutated code. The mutations introduced to source code are designed to imitate common programming errors. A good unit test suite typically detects the program mutations and fails automatically.”
* [Pitest](http://pitest.org/) - Java mutation testing

### **Property-based Testing**

* [Eris](https://github.com/giorgiosironi/eris) - \#php
* [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - "[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/) is a Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldn’t have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy to add to any existing test suite." \#python
* [JSVerify](http://jsverify.github.io) - \#javascript
* [PhpQuickCheck](http://phpquickcheck) - \#php
* [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) - “The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.” \#haskell
* [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org) - “ScalaCheck is a library written in Scala and used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs. ScalaCheck was originally inspired by the Haskell library QuickCheck, but has also ventured into its own.” \#scala
* [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org) - \#scala
