# Paradigms

[Programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) \#article - Wikipedia. "**Programming paradigms** are a way to classify [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms."

## Aspect-Oriented Software Development

[Aspect-oriented software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_software_development) \#article - Wikipedia. "In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), **aspect-oriented software development** \(AOSD\) is a [software development technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_methodology) that seeks new modularizations of [software systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system) in order to isolate secondary or supporting functions from the main program's [business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic). AOSD allows multiple [concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_%28computer_science%29) to be expressed separately and automatically unified into working systems."

[Cross-cutting concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern) \#article - Wikipedia. "In [aspect-oriented software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_software_development), **cross-cutting concerns** are [aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_%28computer_programming%29) of a [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that affect other [concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_%28computer_science%29). These concerns often cannot be cleanly [decomposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_%28programming%29) from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation, and can result in either _scattering_ \([code duplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_duplication)\), _tangling_ \(significant dependencies between systems\), or both."

## Functional Programming

[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) \#article - Wikipedia. "In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **functional programming** is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)—a style of building the structure and elements of [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)—that treats [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) as the evaluation of [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29) and avoids changing-[state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_state) and [mutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) data. It is a [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) paradigm in that programming is done with [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28computer_science%29) or declarations[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#cite_note-expression_style-1) instead of [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_%28computer_science%29). Functional code is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence): a function's return value depends only on its [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_argument), so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's resulting value. Eliminating [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29), that is, changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make understanding a program easier, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming."
