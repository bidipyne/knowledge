[Biggest Challenge You'll Face Learning to Code \(Plus How to Overcome It!\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-sh_ncnDUE) \#video - "Learning any new skill is challenging and I've definitely noticed a recurring theme that most everybody faces: how to stay motivated when progress seems to be non-existent \(also know as the intermediate plateau\). There's is no easy answer or magic pill but I definitely laid out a few pieces of advice of how to overcome it."

[CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) - "Continuous Integration \(CI\) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. ❡ By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily."

[GoodReads: Genre &gt; Computer Science &gt; Software](https://www.goodreads.com/genres/software) - A collection of the most-read and most-popular books on software development on GoodReads.

[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) \#software - "The goal of the project is to create a beautiful and extensible experience for command-line interface users, built on open web standards. In the beginning, our focus will be primarily around speed, stability and the development of the correct API for extension authors."

[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) - "Lobsters is a computing-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion, launched on July 1st, 2012. The administrator is [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://lobste.rs/u/pushcx) \("pushcx"\), contact him with any support issues. Lobsters was created by [joshua stein](https://lobste.rs/u/jcs) with some specific design goals in mind to avoid problems faced by other link aggregation sites."

[Local Composer Package Development](https://medium.com/pvtl/local-composer-package-development-47ac5c0e5bb4) \#article - "When developing a package for say, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), you’d want to incorporate that package into your vendor folder so that you can test its integration into the project and how it would behave as if someone had pulled it from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)."

## Refactoring

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) - "**Refactoring.Guru** makes it easy for you to discover everything you need to know about refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles and other smart programming topics."

[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring) \#book

[Testing Legacy Code Elliotte by Rusty Harold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxXv0eifhY) \#video - "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Sadly, it wasn't always this way. You're saddled with a large legacy of untested code. Test first development is not an option. Nonetheless unit testing, JUnit, and test driven development can still dramatically improve your maintenance tasks. Learn strategies for retrofitting test frameworks onto existing code, and developing a test suite for code that never had one before."
