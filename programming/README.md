# Software Development

[Biggest Challenge You'll Face Learning to Code \(Plus How to Overcome It!\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-sh_ncnDUE) \#video - "Learning any new skill is challenging and I've definitely noticed a recurring theme that most everybody faces: how to stay motivated when progress seems to be non-existent \(also know as the intermediate plateau\). There's is no easy answer or magic pill but I definitely laid out a few pieces of advice of how to overcome it."

[CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) - "Continuous Integration \(CI\) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. ❡ By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily."

[frp](https://frp.ai/) - "frp™ is a reliable Enterprise level face recognition system for commercial use"

[GoodReads: Genre &gt; Computer Science &gt; Software](https://www.goodreads.com/genres/software) - A collection of the most-read and most-popular books on software development on GoodReads.

[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) \#software - "The goal of the project is to create a beautiful and extensible experience for command-line interface users, built on open web standards. In the beginning, our focus will be primarily around speed, stability and the development of the correct API for extension authors."

[Lepton](https://hackjutsu.com/Lepton/) \#software  - "A Lean GitHub Gist Client"

[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) - "Lobsters is a computing-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion, launched on July 1st, 2012. The administrator is [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://lobste.rs/u/pushcx) \("pushcx"\), contact him with any support issues. Lobsters was created by [joshua stein](https://lobste.rs/u/jcs) with some specific design goals in mind to avoid problems faced by other link aggregation sites."

[Local Composer Package Development](https://medium.com/pvtl/local-composer-package-development-47ac5c0e5bb4) \#article - "When developing a package for say, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), you’d want to incorporate that package into your vendor folder so that you can test its integration into the project and how it would behave as if someone had pulled it from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)."

## Abstract Syntax Trees

[Abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) \#article - Wikipedia. "In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **abstract syntax tree** \(**AST**\), or just **syntax tree**, is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_tree) representation of the [abstract syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax) structure of [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) written in a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code."

[AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) \#webapp - "Paste or drop some JavaScript here and explore the syntax tree created by chosen parser. You can use all the cool new features from ES6 and even more. Enjoy!" [List of parsers.](https://github.com/fkling/astexplorer/blob/master/README.md)

[Deciphering Python: How to use Abstract Syntax Trees \(AST\) to understand code](https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2018/decipher-python-ast/) \#article - "Because Python is a “batteries included” language, the tools you need to use ASTs are built into the standard library."

[jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) \#software - "jscodeshift is a toolkit for running codemods over multiple JavaScript or TypeScript files."

[Python AST module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) - "The [`ast`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#module-ast) module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like."

[recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) \#software - "Recast exposes two essential interfaces, one for parsing JavaScript code \(`require("recast").parse`\) and the other for reprinting modified syntax trees \(`require("recast").print`\)."

## API Design

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) \#software - "Simplifies API Development. Get easy, API-First solutions with the industry's only complete API Development Environment."

[Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) - "Beautiful static documentation for your API"

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - "Swagger open source and pro tools have helped millions of API developers, teams, and organizations deliver great APIs."

## Integrated Development Environments

[Atom](https://atom.io/) \#software - "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century"

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) - "Debug APIs like a human, not a robot. Finally, a REST client you'll love"

[Komodo](https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/) - "Code faster with the IDE for today’s web languages – Python, PHP, Perl, Golang, Ruby and more. For Windows, Mac and Linux."

[PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) \#software - "The Lightning-Smart PHP IDE"

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) \#software - “Postman Makes API Development Simple. Developers use Postman to build modern software for the API-first world.”

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) \#software - "The Python IDE for Professional Developers"

## Refactoring

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) - "**Refactoring.Guru** makes it easy for you to discover everything you need to know about refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles and other smart programming topics."

[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring) \#book

[Testing Legacy Code Elliotte by Rusty Harold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxXv0eifhY) \#video - "You've been bitten by the testing bug, are thoroughly test infected. Excellent! You're undoubtedly producing more robust, less buggy software faster and at lower cost. Sadly, it wasn't always this way. You're saddled with a large legacy of untested code. Test first development is not an option. Nonetheless unit testing, JUnit, and test driven development can still dramatically improve your maintenance tasks. Learn strategies for retrofitting test frameworks onto existing code, and developing a test suite for code that never had one before."
