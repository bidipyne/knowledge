[Deep Habits: The Importance of Planning Every Minute of Your Work Day](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/) \#article - "I call this planning method _time blocking_. I take time blocking seriously, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to building my schedule for the next day. During this planning process I consult my task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. My goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right  pace for the relevant deadlines."

[Overcommitters Club](https://overcommitters.club/) - "OVERCOMMITTERS CLUB is a monthly "event" for folks like us, who sign up for too many things, and need to reclaim that time every once in awhile. We like to think we're the only recurring event that's happy when you're a no-show."

[Procrastination Research Group](https://www.procrastination.ca/) - "Over the past 20 years, our exclusive focus has been on researching the breakdown in volitional action we commonly call procrastination. We seek to understand why we become our own worst enemy at times with needless, voluntary delay. Although our research and site originates at Carleton University \(Ottawa, Canada\), it represents a compilation of information and research on procrastination from all over the world." Creators of the iProcrastinate podcast.
