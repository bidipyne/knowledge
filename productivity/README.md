[Android and Beeminder and Tasker](https://blog.beeminder.com/beedroid/) \#article - "Tasker is like [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) for your Android. It exposes triggers and events that you can string together kind of like a recipe. It lets you plug in Beeminder as the event portion of a recipe, and so you can do things like automatically mind your sleep based on how long your phone’s display is off at night, or start a timer every time you launch Candy Crush Saga, and stop and submit the datapoint every time you quit the app. "

Sometimes things aren’t as simple as they seem, and other times things are actually simpler than they seem. This part will be dedicated to various tips and tricks for using Tasker, things that aren’t as obvious as they perhaps should be. I’ve tried to think of as many as I can, but there might be a second tips and tricks in the future if I think of more."

I take time blocking seriously, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to building my schedule for the next day. During this planning process I consult my task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. My goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right  pace for the relevant deadlines."
