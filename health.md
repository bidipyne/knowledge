[Effects of Bite Count Feedback from a Wearable Device and Goal Setting on Consumption in Young Adults](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672%2816%2930222-2/abstract) \#paper - "Providing feedback on the number of bites taken from a wearable intake monitor can reduce overall intake during a single meal. Regarding the first research question, providing feedback significantly reduced intake in both plate size groups and reduced the overall number of bites taken. Regarding the second research question, participants were successful in eating to their goals. However, individuals in the low goal condition appeared to compensate for the restricted goal by taking larger bites, leading to comparable levels of consumption between the low and high goal groups. Hence, the interaction of technology with goals should be considered when introducing a health intervention."
