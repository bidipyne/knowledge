## Futures Thinking

[Backcasting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting) \#article - "**Backcasting** is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting#cite_note-1) The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the [University of Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Waterloo) in 1990.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting#cite_note-Robinson_1990-2) The fundamental question of backcasting asks: "if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?"[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting#cite_note-4)"

[The Fourth Way: Design Thinking Meets Futures Thinking](https://medium.com/@anna.roumiantseva/the-fourth-way-design-thinking-meets-futures-thinking-85793ae3aa1e) \#article - "They say “hindsight is 20/20”. If only you knew then what you know now, you would have sold that stock, ended that relationship, or taken that job offer in a snap. Of course the tricky part is being able to make those decisions in the present, but how do you do that without knowing what’s lurking around the corner? I want to argue that by making Futures Thinking a standard part of your thought process — both in your business and personal lives — you’ll be able to make better decisions in the face of uncertainty."

My job has been to provide people with insights into emerging trends and issues, to allow them to do _their_ jobs better. I’ve done this work for big companies and government agencies \(usually under the Very Professional sounding title of strategic foresight\), and for TV writers and game companies. It’s quite an enjoyable job, as it allows me to indulge my easily-distracted curiosity about the world."

[Pre-mortem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem) \#article - "A **pre-mortem**, or **premortem**, is a [managerial strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management) in which a project team imagines that a project or organization has failed, and then works backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure of the project or organization.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem#cite_note-hbr-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem#cite_note-2)"
