# Rationality

[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) - "**Farnam Street** \(FS\) helps you master the best of what other people have already figured out. Together we will develop the [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) to understand how the world works, make better decisions, and live a more meaningful life."

[Is Most Published Research Wrong?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q) \#video - "Mounting evidence suggests a lot of published research is false."

[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) \#blog - "_LessWrong_ is a community blog devoted to the art of human rationality."

[Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions \(109 Models Explained\)](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) \#article - "Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason."

[The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't by Nate Silver \| Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise?from_search=true&qid=MEEN6mCMC4&rank=1) \#book - "Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the "prediction paradox": The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future."

## Bayes' Theorem

[Bayes.com](https://bayes.com/) - "We’re excited to bring you BAYES — a creative, no-code tool for thinking and speaking with data."

[The Bayesian Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13BD8qKeTg&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "Bayes' theorem explained with examples and implications for life."

[Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) \#article - "One of the many applications of Bayes’ theorem is [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), a particular approach to [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference). When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes’ theorem may have different [probability interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretation). With [Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics)."

Crash Course

* [You know I’m all about that Bayes: Crash Course Statistics \#24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "Today we’re going to talk about Bayes Theorem and Bayesian hypothesis testing. Bayesian methods like these are different from how we've been approaching statistics so far, because they allow us to update our beliefs as we gather new information - which is how we tend to think naturally about the world. And this can be a really powerful tool, since it allows us to incorporate both scientifically rigorous data AND our previous biases into our evolving opinions."
* [Bayes in science and everyday life: Crash Course Statistics \#25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bLRF02b4w&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&index=26) \#video - "Today we're going to finish up our discussion of Bayesian inference by showing you how we can it be used for continuous data sets and be applied both in science and everyday life. From A/B testing of websites and getting a better understanding of psychological disorders to helping with language translation and purchase recommendations Bayes statistics really are being used everywhere!"

[A visual guide to Bayesian thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK7X_XlGB8) \#video - "I use pictures to illustrate the mechanics of "Bayes' rule," a mathematical theorem about how to update your beliefs as you encounter new evidence. Then I tell three stories from my life that show how I use Bayes' rule to improve my thinking."
