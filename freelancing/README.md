# Freelancing

[Everything I know about freelancing](https://andyadams.org/everything-i-know-about-freelancing/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav) \#article - "You’ve probably read a lot about freelancing: Feast and famine. Where to find clients. How much to charge. These topics are fundamental, but it seems like most freelancers burn out before they get over these hurdles. Can freelancing be a stable, long-term career?"

[Hiveage](https://www.hiveage.com/) \#webapp - "Best Online Invoicing Software. Trusted by 60,000 small businesses and freelancers from 152 countries."

[A job without a boss](https://seths.blog/2019/04/a-job-without-a-boss-2/) \#article - "**Freelancers** get paid when they work. We’re not focused on scale… and we’re not tiny versions of real entrepreneurs. Freelancers do the work for clients who need them. Hiring employees to scale when you’re a freelancer can be a bit of a trap, because you are likely to give up the very thing you set out to do in the first place."

[“You can hire just about anyone…”](https://seths.blog/2019/04/avoiding-the-fiver-trap/) \#article - "Websites that offer lowest common denominator jobs for freelancers \(like Fiverr, Uber, ZocDoc, Mechanical Turk etc.\) are focused on the generic. They intentionally blur the identities of the people doing the work–a simple star rating, a measure of reliability, that’s all."
