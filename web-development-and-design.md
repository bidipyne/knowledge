# Web Development & Design

## Accessibility & Usability

[Calculating Color Contrast](https://24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast/) \#article - “Some websites and services allow you to customize your profile by uploading pictures, changing the background color or other aspects of the design. As a customer, this personalization turns a web app into your little nest where you store your data. As a designer, letting your customers have free rein over the layout and design is a scary prospect. So what happens to all the stock text and images that are designed to work on nice white backgrounds? Even the Mac only lets you choose between two colors for the OS, blue or graphite! Opening up the ability to customize your site’s color scheme can be a recipe for disaster unless you are flexible and understand how to find maximum color contrasts.” \#javascript \#php \#color \#accessibility

[Pixels vs. Ems: Users DO Change Font Size](https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773) \#article - “The question was “How many users browse the main Internet Archive site with a default font size other than the common value of 16 pixels?” By knowing this, we would determine how many users would be affected by sizing with relative units like rems/ems. Using the methodology I describe below, we found that the answer is 3.08% of our users. That’s a pretty big number, higher than most counts of the market share of browsers like Internet Explorer, Edge, or Opera Mini.”
