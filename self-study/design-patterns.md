[_Dive Into Design Patterns_](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book) \#book - "**Design patterns** help you solve commonly-occurring problems in software design. But you canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. A pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code."
