# JavaScript

## Snippets

Referencing `this` inside a callback can be tricky, since `this` refers to the context where the function is called, not where it is defined. To explicitly bind `this` to the defining context, [use the `bind()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind):

```javascript
myFunction(callback.bind(this))
```

But, did you know that it doesn't have to be this way? Hasn't `console.log()` already bored you with its **monolithic** output? Do you want to make your logs better, to make them **prettier**? ðŸ’… If so, follow me, as we'll discover how colorful and playful Console API can really be!"
