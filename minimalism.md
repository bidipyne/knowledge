[How Minimalism Can Make You More Productive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CttGNGjwp6A&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "One of the biggest benefits I’ve received from living a life with less, has been that I’ve been able to create more. In this video I break down five ways that I've applied minimalism to my work life."

[How to Prevent the Internet From Taking Over Your Life: Digital Minimalism 06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEps2fnwL-0&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "It's way too easy now to let the internet be a part of every aspect of our lives.

[I tried "Swedish Death Cleaning" \(and it worked!\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNbAbhQZFA&feature=youtu.be) \#video - "Hey, guys! In today's video I took a big step and helped Charlie tackle his closet. I cleaned and organized the space \(not something high on his priority list\), and I uncovered lots of things that I just failed to deal with for years. I've been reading a lot about Swedish Death Cleaning and many of the goals really resonated with me, and I hope they help you think about decluttering in a new way. Enjoy!"
