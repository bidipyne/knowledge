[Everything I know about freelancing](https://andyadams.org/everything-i-know-about-freelancing/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav) \#article - "You’ve probably read a lot about freelancing: Feast and famine. Where to find clients. How much to charge. These topics are fundamental, but it seems like most freelancers burn out before they get over these hurdles. Can freelancing be a stable, long-term career?"

## Estimating

* [Evidence Based Scheduling](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/) \#article - by Joel Spolsky. “Over the last year or so at Fog Creek we’ve been developing a system that’s so easy even our grouchiest developers are willing to go along with it. And as far as we can tell, it produces extremely reliable schedules. It’s called Evidence-Based Scheduling, or EBS. You gather evidence, mostly from historical timesheet data, that you feed back into your schedules. What you get is not just one ship date: you get a confidence distribution curve, showing the probability that you will ship on any given date.”
* [Evidence Based Scheduling](https://www.fogbugz.com/evidence-based-scheduling.html) \#article - FogBugz explanation. “EBS it’s a statistical algorithm that produces ship date probability distributions. It gather evidence, mostly from historical timesheet data and provides accurate schedules. It produces a probability distribution curve, so that you know for any given date, the probability that your project will be completed by it. EBS is perfect for forgetful team members, and it also takes into account factors like holidays and vacation time. It even consider contributions from those who only occasionally get a chance to work on project stuff too, like busy managers!”
* [Evidence-based scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_scheduling) \#article - on Wikipedia. “Evidence-based scheduling is a software estimation approach created by Joel Spolsky, a commentator on software engineering principles. Evidence-based Scheduling is based on at least two core ideas: including all time spent, and using a Monte Carlo completion date prediction method.”

It’s called Evidence Based Scheduling, and you’ll learn how to apply it to accurately predict when software projects will be ready."
